Title: TBG-V1 Overview

Vision
A classic, old-school JRPG inspired by Dragon Quest: party-based, turn-based combat, simple menus, simple progression, and a story delivered through dialogue and choices. The v1 version is CLI-only to keep systems clean and testable.

Core pillars

Turn-based combat with speed-based initiative.

Data-driven content: monsters, items, weapons, armour, abilities, story nodes live in JSON files.

Weapon-driven skills: abilities require weapon tags (ex: “sword”), and basic attack is defined by the equipped weapon.

Deterministic gameplay: all randomness is controlled by a single seeded RNG.

Maintainable architecture: domain logic is separate from CLI printing and input.

Local LLM integration (future scope)
Party banter and party-member talk will eventually be generated by a local LLM constrained by character profiles and augmented using RAG. This must be optional and must not affect deterministic core game logic.

Non-goals for v1

No GUI.

No complex crafting or economy simulation.

No big open world systems.

No heavy branching story logic in Python. Story is data-driven nodes.

Success criteria for v1

You can start a new game with a seed.

You can enter a battle, take turns, win or lose.

Inventory and item use works (at least potions).

Weapons define basic attack, armour defines defense.

Story nodes can move you between scenes and trigger battles or rewards.

Core domain logic is unit tested.
